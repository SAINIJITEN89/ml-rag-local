Python Programming Guide

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features:
- Easy to learn and use
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Object-oriented programming support
- Dynamic typing
- Interpreted execution

Data Types in Python:
1. Numbers: int, float, complex
2. Strings: text data enclosed in quotes
3. Lists: ordered, mutable collections
4. Tuples: ordered, immutable collections
5. Dictionaries: key-value pairs
6. Sets: unordered collections of unique elements

Control Structures:
- if/elif/else statements for conditional execution
- for loops for iteration over sequences
- while loops for repeated execution based on conditions
- try/except blocks for error handling

Functions:
Functions in Python are defined using the 'def' keyword. They can accept parameters and return values.

Example:
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

Libraries and Modules:
Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries including:
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Django and Flask for web development
- Requests for HTTP operations

Best Practices:
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write docstrings for functions
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Use virtual environments for project dependencies
