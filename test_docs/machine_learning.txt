Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Goal: predict outcomes for new data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Uses unlabeled data
   - Goal: discover hidden patterns
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient

Key Concepts:

Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
Test Data: The dataset used to evaluate model performance
Features: Input variables used to make predictions
Labels: Output variables (in supervised learning)
Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns

Model Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): For regression problems

Cross-Validation:
A technique to assess how well a model will generalize to unseen data by dividing the dataset into multiple folds.

Feature Engineering:
The process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data to improve model performance.

Popular ML Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: General-purpose ML library
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting library
- Keras: High-level neural network API
