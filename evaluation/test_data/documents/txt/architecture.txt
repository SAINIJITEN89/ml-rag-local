System Architecture Document

Project: Advanced Analytics Platform
Version: 2.1
Date: 2024-01-20

OVERVIEW:
The Advanced Analytics Platform follows a microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes clusters. The system is designed for high availability, scalability, and maintainability.

ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS:

1. Frontend Layer
   - React.js application served via CDN
   - nginx reverse proxy for load balancing
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
   - WebSocket connections for real-time updates

2. API Gateway
   - Kong API Gateway for request routing
   - Rate limiting and authentication middleware
   - Request/response transformation
   - Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance

3. Core Services
   a) User Management Service
      - Spring Boot application
      - PostgreSQL database for user data
      - Redis cache for session management
      - Keycloak integration for SSO

   b) Data Processing Service
      - Apache Kafka for event streaming
      - Apache Spark for big data processing
      - Elasticsearch for search capabilities
      - MinIO object storage for file handling

   c) Analytics Service
      - Python Flask microservice
      - TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML models
      - MLflow for model versioning
      - Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration

   d) Notification Service
      - Node.js application
      - RabbitMQ message queue
      - Integration with email/SMS providers
      - WebSocket server for real-time notifications

4. Data Layer
   - PostgreSQL cluster for transactional data
   - MongoDB for document storage
   - Redis cluster for caching
   - Apache Cassandra for time-series data

5. Infrastructure Services
   - Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
   - ELK stack for centralized logging
   - Vault for secrets management
   - Consul for service discovery

DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE:

1. Multi-Zone Kubernetes Cluster
   - 3 availability zones for high availability
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
   - Rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments
   - Pod disruption budgets for stability

2. Networking
   - Istio service mesh for service communication
   - Network policies for security isolation
   - Load balancers for external traffic
   - Private subnets for database layers

3. Security Architecture
   - mTLS for service-to-service communication
   - Network segmentation and firewalls
   - Identity and access management (IAM)
   - Regular security scanning and updates

DATA FLOW:
1. Data ingestion through Kafka topics
2. Processing via Spark streaming jobs
3. Transformation and enrichment
4. Storage in appropriate data stores
5. Analytics processing and model inference
6. Results served through API endpoints
7. Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
