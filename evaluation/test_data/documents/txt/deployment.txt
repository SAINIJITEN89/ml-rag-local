Deployment Strategy Document

Project: Advanced Analytics Platform
Version: 2.1
Date: 2024-01-25

DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENTS:

1. Development Environment
   - Single Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes
   - Shared resources for all development teams
   - Automated deployment on code commit
   - Mock services for external dependencies
   - Debugging and profiling tools enabled

2. Staging Environment
   - Production-like setup with reduced capacity
   - Full integration testing environment
   - Performance testing capabilities
   - Security scanning and compliance checks
   - Blue-green deployment strategy

3. Production Environment
   - Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery
   - Primary region: us-east-1 (Virginia)
   - Secondary region: us-west-2 (Oregon)
   - Automated failover mechanisms
   - 24/7 monitoring and alerting

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:

1. CI/CD Pipeline
   - GitLab CI/CD for automation
   - Automated testing at multiple stages
   - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Artifact building and registry storage
   - Approval gates for production deployments

2. Blue-Green Deployment
   - Parallel environments for zero-downtime updates
   - Traffic switching through load balancer
   - Rollback capabilities within 2 minutes
   - Automated health checks and validation
   - Gradual traffic migration (canary deployments)

3. Database Migration Strategy
   - Forward-compatible schema changes
   - Migration scripts with rollback procedures
   - Database backup before deployments
   - Read replica promotion for major upgrades
   - Zero-downtime migration techniques

INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE:

1. Terraform for Infrastructure
   - Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
   - Modular and reusable components
   - Automated provisioning and updates
   - State management and locking
   - Cost optimization through resource tagging

2. Helm Charts for Applications
   - Parameterized Kubernetes deployments
   - Environment-specific value files
   - Dependency management
   - Rolling updates and rollbacks
   - Resource limits and requests

MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:

1. Application Metrics
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards for visualization
   - Custom business metrics tracking
   - SLA/SLO monitoring
   - Automated alerting rules

2. Logging Strategy
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack
   - Structured logging format (JSON)
   - Log aggregation and correlation
   - Log retention policies
   - Security audit trails

3. Distributed Tracing
   - Jaeger for request tracing
   - Service dependency mapping
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Error tracking and analysis
   - Correlation with metrics and logs

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Container Security
   - Base image scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Runtime security monitoring
   - Network policies and segmentation
   - Pod security standards enforcement
   - Regular security updates

2. Secrets Management
   - HashiCorp Vault for secret storage
   - Automated secret rotation
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Access control and audit logging
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

DISASTER RECOVERY:

1. Backup Strategy
   - Automated daily backups
   - Cross-region backup replication
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities
   - Backup testing and validation
   - Recovery time objective (RTO): 4 hours
   - Recovery point objective (RPO): 1 hour

2. Failover Procedures
   - Automated health checks
   - DNS-based traffic routing
   - Database replication and promotion
   - Application state synchronization
   - Communication plans and runbooks
